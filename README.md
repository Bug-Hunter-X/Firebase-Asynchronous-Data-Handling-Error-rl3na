This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications related to asynchronous data handling.  The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect approach, where data is accessed outside the asynchronous callback, potentially leading to undefined values.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the correct solution, ensuring that data processing occurs only after the data has been successfully retrieved.
